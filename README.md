## Getting Started

To get started with this course, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- Apache Maven for building Java projects
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Adding Tomcat Server

To deploy and run your Java EE applications locally, you can use Apache Tomcat, an open-source web server and servlet container. Follow these steps to add Tomcat to your development environment:

1. **Download Tomcat**: Visit the [Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/) and download the latest version of Tomcat appropriate for your operating system.

2. **Extract the Archive**: Extract the downloaded Tomcat archive to a location on your computer.

3. **Configure Tomcat in your IDE**:
   - **IntelliJ IDEA**: 
     - Open IntelliJ IDEA and navigate to `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Application Servers`.
     - Click the `+` icon and select `Tomcat Server` > `Local`.
     - Choose the directory where you extracted Tomcat in the previous step.
     - Click `OK` to add the server.

   - **Eclipse**:
     - Open Eclipse and navigate to `Window` > `Preferences` > `Server` > `Runtime Environments`.
     - Click `Add` and select `Apache Tomcat`.
     - Choose the directory where you extracted Tomcat in the previous step.
     - Click `Finish` to add the server.

4. **Start Tomcat**: After adding Tomcat to your IDE, you can start the server from within the IDE. Once Tomcat is running, you can deploy your Java EE applications to it.
